| Brain Area | Primary Network(s) | Description in Psychedelic Context |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC) | Default Mode Network (DMN) | Hub for self-awareness; shows decreased activity and decoupling, promoting flexible thinking. |
| Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC) | Default Mode Network (DMN) | Integrates personal experiences; connectivity weakens, linked to ego dissolution. |
| Anterior Hippocampus | Default Mode Network (DMN) | Handles memory; reduced functional connectivity with DMN during and post-trip, aiding insights. |
| Amygdala | Salience Network, Limbic System | Processes emotions; decreased reactivity and altered connectivity, reducing fear. |
| Visual Cortex | Sensory Networks | Increased activity and connections, contributing to hallucinations. |
| Auditory Cortex | Sensory Networks | Heightened integration with other areas, enhancing perceptual changes. |
| Thalamus (Mediodorsal and Paraventricular Nuclei) | Thalamo-Cortical Networks | Relays signals; desynchronizes, allowing novel information flow. |
| Anteromedial Caudate (part of Basal Ganglia) | Subcortical Networks, DMN-linked | Involved in motivation; shows connectivity changes for behavioral flexibility. |
| Frontoparietal Regions | Frontoparietal Network (FPN) | Attention control; increased integration with sensory and limbic systems. |
| Cerebellum (DMN-connected parts) | Cerebellar Networks, DMN | Motor and cognitive roles; exhibits functional connectivity shifts. |
